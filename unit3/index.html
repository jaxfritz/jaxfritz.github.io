    <p>Founded in 2009, Body by Design is the manifestation of my desire to recognize and introduce design thinking methodologies into a movement repertoire. Years of dance, physical therapy and comprehensive yoga+pilates training has led me to design and and around the globe, teaching dynamic structures of the body as we move through space.</p>
