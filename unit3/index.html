    <p>Founded in 2009, Body of Design is the manifestation of my desire to recognize and introduce design thinking methodologies into a movement repertoire. Years of dance, physical therapy and comprehensive yoga+pilates training has led me to design, and worldwide, to teach the dynamic structures of the body as we move through space.</p>
