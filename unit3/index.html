    <p>Founded in 2009, Body by Design is the manifestation of my desire to recognize and introduce how design thinking methodologies might address a movement repertoire. Years of dance, physical therapy and comprehensive yoga+pilates training has led me toward design, and around the globe, to inform dynamic structures of the body as we move through space.</p>
